Jake Tapper (00:35):
Live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, this is the CNN Republican Presidential Debate. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world watching us on CNN, CNN Max, CNN International, CNN en Espanol and CNN.com. Good evening, I’m Jake Tapper, moderating tonight’s debate alongside my friend and colleague Dana Bash.
Dana Bash (00:58):
And just five days from now voters here in Iowa will cast the first votes of the 2024 presidential race. Tonight, the very first one-on-one matchup between top contenders, Governor Ron DeSantis and former Governor and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. Former President Trump met the requirements for tonight’s debate but declined to participate.
Jake Tapper (01:19):
Our commitment in this debate is to provide as much information as possible to voters, especially here in Iowa before the first contests begin next week. So in choosing topics, we focused on the issues important to Republicans. Let’s bring out the candidates now. Please welcome Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Please welcome former South Carolina Governor and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.
Ron DeSantis (01:50):
Good to see you.
Dana Bash (02:03):
Candidates, please take your positions behind the podiums while we remind you and our audience of the ground rules. Each of you will have 90 seconds to answer questions, 60 seconds for responses and rebuttals and 15 seconds for clarifications. Timing lights will remind you when time is expiring.
Jake Tapper (02:22):
We also remind our audience here in the Sheslow Auditorium at Drake University to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and can hear each other.
Dana Bash (02:32):
Just hours ago, the Republican field narrowed once again, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ended his bid for the presidency. So with one fewer candidate in the running, let’s start with the decision voters here in Iowa are about to face. Governor DeSantis, why should voters who are looking for an alternative to the current front-runner, former President Trump, vote for you rather than former Governor Haley?
Ron DeSantis (02:58):
Well, to the people of Iowa, good evening, it’s great to be in Iowa to have a debate here. Donald Trump’s running to pursue his issues, Nikki Haley’s running to pursue her donor’s issues, I’m running to pursue your issues and your family’s issues and to turn this country around. I’m the only one running that’s delivered on 100% of the promises that I’ve made, we’ve delivered huge victories in the state of Florida, things that Republicans have been asking for for a generation. I’m also the only one running that has beaten the left time and time again, we beat the Teacher’s Union on universal school choice, we beat Soros on crime, we beat Fauci on Covid, we beat the Dems on election integrity, and I beat the left by banning China from buying land in the state of Florida.
Now, Nikki Haley is running, we don’t need another mealy mouth politician who just tells you what she thinks you want to hear just to try to get your vote then to get into office and to do her donors bidding. She was in another state and she said the people of Iowa’s votes need to be corrected. This is somebody that wrote in her book that Hillary Clinton inspired her to first run for office. I remember Hillary denigrating people on the Republican side as deplorables, we don’t need a candidate who’s going to look down on Middle America, we’ve had enough of that. I’m the only one that’s going to be able to lead this country’s revival, I’m asking for your support and I won’t let you down.
Dana Bash (04:20):
Governor Haley, your response?
Nikki Haley (04:22):
Well, I think this is a time that we know that we need a new generational leader. We have watched our country be in disarray, we see the world on fire and we need someone who’s had executive experience. I’ve been a two-term governor that took a double-digit unemployment state and turned it into an economic powerhouse. I was at the UN, I dealt with Russia, China, Iran every day. But you’re going to find out tonight that there’s going to be a lot of Ron’s lies that have happened, there are at least a couple of dozen so far that he’s done.
So what we’re going to do, is rather than have him go and tell you all his lies, you can go to DeSantisLies.com and look at all of those, there’s at least two dozen lies that he’s told about me, and you can see where fact-checkers say exactly what’s going to happen and exactly why it’s wrong. So it will cover the fact that he’s only mad about the donors, because the donors used to be with him, but they’re no longer with him now and that’s because he’s upset about the fact that his campaign is exploding. You’re going to see the fact that he has switched his policies multiple times and we’ll call that out tonight. But every time he lies, Drake University, don’t turn this into a drinking game, because you’ll be over served by the end of the night.
Dana Bash (05:30):
Governor DeSantis.
Ron DeSantis (05:32):
Well, I think this is interesting because you can actually go to RonDeSantis.com, because Nikki Haley has this tactic, if you hold her accountable to her record, first, she’ll say, “I never said that.” Well, one good rule of thumb, if she says she’s never said something, that definitely means she said it and then she’ll say, “You’re lying, you’re lying.” That means not only did she say it, but she’s on video tape saying it, and so we have all the greatest hits. The reality is Nikki Haley is not somebody that has been willing to stand in and fight on behalf of conservatives. She ran for governor saying she was going to do universal school choice and she caved to the Teacher’s Union. She didn’t deliver that. In Florida, I delivered the largest expansion of school choice in the history of the United States. I beat the Teacher’s Union and you know what the results are? When she was governor of South Carolina, she was rated 50th in education, dead last. You know where Florida is under my watch? Number one in the nation.
Dana Bash (06:27):
Your response, Governor Haley?
Nikki Haley (06:32):
Go to DeSantisLies.com and you can find out for yourself, but why don’t we talk about the fact that if we’re going to say this, when Ron was representing Florida, he said that he promised not to raise the debt limit when he got to DC, yet he raised the debt limit by hundreds of billions of dollars. He used to support Ukraine, he supported Ukraine when President Obama was in office, now he’s trying to copy Trump and saying that he no longer supports Ukraine, he doesn’t want to give them foreign aid anymore. He also goes and says that he wants to talk about me insulting Iowans, Iowans know when you’re telling a joke, the fact that he’s only running in one state is not the way you win President, I’m running in all states. But he should tell Iowans why he authored legislation to ban the renewable fuel standard that’s so important to Iowans’ economy and the fact that he co-sponsored five different pieces of legislation to get rid of it.
And also, then he also said he would never do anything with Social Security yet he voted three times to raise the retirement age of Social Security.
Jake Tapper (07:33):
Thank you Governor.
Nikki Haley (07:33):
So if you’re going to talk about what you’ve said—
Jake Tapper (07:35):
Thank you Governor.
Nikki Haley (07:36):
And what you did, I think you’ve got your own explaining to do rather—
Jake Tapper (07:38):
Well—
Nikki Haley (07:39):
Than telling lies about me.
Jake Tapper (07:40):
Well, thank you Governor. We’re going to get to a lot of these issues in the debate. Governor Haley, when Governor Christie dropped out of the race just a few hours ago, he said the most important issue is, “The character of the candidate.” Governor Christie also said he ran because he knew he would be the only Republican candidate to speak the truth about former President Donald Trump. Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be president again?
Nikki Haley (08:03):
Well, I think the next president needs to have moral clarity. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that it’s taxpayer money, not your own money. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that when you’re dealing with dictators in the world, that we always have to fight for democracies and human rights and protecting Americans and preventing war. And so when you look at Donald Trump, I have said, I think he was the right president at the right time, I agree with a lot of his policies, but his way is not my way. I don’t have vengeance, I don’t have vendettas, I don’t take things personally. For me, it’s very much about no drama, no whining, and getting results and getting them done. So I don’t think that President Trump is the right president to go forward. I think it’s time for a new generational leader that’s going to go and make America proud again, that’s what I’m going to try and do.
Jake Tapper (08:49):
Governor DeSantis, what is your response to Chris Christie? Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be president again?
Ron DeSantis (08:55):
Well, I’m running because I’m the guy that’s going to be able to engineer a comeback for this country. I appreciated what President Trump did, but let’s just be honest, he said he was going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it, he did not deliver that. He said he was going to drain the swamp, he did not deliver that. He said he was going to hold Hillary accountable and he let her off the hook. He said he was going to eliminate the debt and he added $7.8 trillion to the debt. So we need to deliver and get this stuff done and I think the difference between Nikki Haley and me, I listened to all that litany of stuff, I debated the Governor of California Gavin Newsom, I thought he lied a lot. Man, Nikki Haley gives him a run for his money and she may even be more liberal than Gavin Newsom is.
We are in a situation here, as Republicans, you need somebody that is going to be in there and fight for you and Nikki Haley anytime the going gets tough, anytime people come down, she caves. When you need someone standing and fight for you, don’t look for Nikki Haley, you won’t be able to find her if you had a search warrant.
Jake Tapper (09:55):
Thank you Governor. Governor Haley?
Nikki Haley (09:58):
Look, I think I dealt with Russia, China, Iran, North Korea every day, no one ever said, I caved. I defended America and I fought for America.
But I’ll also say this, this is not a time where you have to have pettiness. I wish Donald Trump was up here on this stage, he’s the one that I’m running against, he’s the one that I wish would be here, he needs to be defending his record. Right now he’s not defending the fact that he allowed us to have $8 trillion in debt over four years, that our kids are never going to forgive us for. The fact that he didn’t deal with China when it came to stealing intellectual property. The fact that they gave us Covid. The fact that they’ve gone and continued to put up Chinese police stations and continue to threaten our military. He didn’t do enough to make sure that we were really standing with our friends and doing some other things.
What we need is a leader that’s not looking at four years and eight years, we need a president that’s looking at 20 and 30 years, because I want my kids to have a good future, I want them to have one without debt, one where they can read, one with secure borders, one where we have law and order and one where America is strong.
Ron DeSantis (11:02):
Well, for off—
Nikki Haley (11:02):
Thank you.
Ron DeSantis (11:03):
With all due respect, for her to single out Donald Trump on China and look, I think he could have been tougher on them, a hundred percent. When Nikki Haley was governor of South Carolina, she was the number one governor in America for Republicans of bringing China into her state. She wrote a love letter to the ambassador, saying that they were a great friend, she’s on video saying, “China’s a friend.” She had five Chinese business, five miles from a military base, there’s a video of her on the website right in front of a Chinese flag saying that she works for them now. So that was her number one achievement as governor, was bringing China into the state of South Carolina. So you say you’re going to look 10, 20, 30 years down the road, why wasn’t she doing that then when people were raising the red flags about it. In Florida, I banned China from buying land in our state and we kicked them out of our university.
Dana Bash (11:44):
Yeah.
Ron DeSantis (11:44):
And we kicked them out of our university.
Dana Bash (11:48):
Governor DeSantis—
Ron DeSantis (11:48):
That’s what you need to be doing.
Dana Bash (11:52):
We’re going to talk about China in a little bit. I want to talk about the economy, which according to a recent Des Moines Register Poll, shows that the economy is the top issue for caucus goers here. So Governor Haley, the rate of inflation is down, prices though are still high and Americans are struggling to afford food, cars and housing. What is the single most important policy that you would implement as president to make the essentials in American’s lives more important?
Nikki Haley (12:21):
I think we have to acknowledge that Republicans and Democrats have both done this. I mean, the fact that they’ve done all of this wasteful spending, they did a $2.2 trillion Covid stimulus bill that expanded welfare that’s now left us with 80 million Americans on Medicaid, 42 million Americans on food stamps, that’s a third of our country. What I will do is, I think it’s time we have an accountant in the White House. We have to have someone that respects taxpayer dollars and we’ll start by clawing back a hundred billion dollars of unspent Covid dollars that are still out there.
Instead of 87,000 IRS agents going after Middle America, we’ll go after the hundreds of billions of dollars of Covid fraud, one out of every $7. If 8% of our budget is interest, quit borrowing, cut out the credit cards. I had to balance a budget as governor, you have to balance a budget every day. Why is Congress the only group that refuses to balance a budget? We’ll stop the spending, we’ll stop the borrowing, we’ll eliminate the pet projects and the earmarks and I’ll veto any spending bill that doesn’t take us back to pre-COVID levels.
And then we want to make sure that we allow the middle class to breathe. We’re going to eliminate the federal gas and diesel tax in this country and cut taxes on the middle class and simplify those brackets. And then we want to make the small business tax cuts permanent, they made corporate tax cuts permanent, but they made small business tax cuts temporary. Small businesses are the heartbeat of America, we need to prove it by making those tax cuts permanent.
Dana Bash (13:51):
Governor DeSantis, what’s your response? How would you make those essentials more affordable for Americans?
Ron DeSantis (13:56):
Well, I disagree with Ambassador Haley, we don’t need an accountant in the White House, we need a leader in the White House. And that’s what I would bring.
I’ve spoken with Iowans, I’m visiting all 99 counties and also folks all across this country. The American dream is slipping away, people are working hard, they’re getting the most out of their God-given ability, they’re doing everything right and they’re falling further and further behind. Trying to afford a new home today, your monthly mortgage payment would probably be twice as much as what it would’ve been if you were starting out five years ago. We have to make the economy work for those folks.
Yes, I’m going to battle the spending, in Florida, you look, we have the National Debt Clock going up to 34 trillion, I see it. If you did a debt clock for the state of Florida, it would be counting down, because we’ve paid down 25% of our state debt just since I’ve been governor. We’re going to open up all energy for production, because that will be deflationary. Nikki Haley, when she was governor, she promised she would never do the gas tax, then she tried to raise the gas tax on hard-working South Carolinians. Here’s the thing, we need to fly a flag of bold colors carrying the banner of putting the American people first, not the pale pastels of the warmed-over corporatism of people like Nikki Haley.
Dana Bash (15:07):
Governor Haley, I want to bring you in, but because Governor DeSantis mentioned the gas tax, you do want to eliminate the federal gas tax and that tax generated approximately $40 billion in 2022 and helps pay for road construction and repair. So how would you fix America’s roads and bridges if you take that money away?
Nikki Haley (15:28):
Well, first of all, bless his heart, DeSantisLies.com, we have never raised a tax.
Ron DeSantis (15:33):
You tried to.
Nikki Haley (15:34):
I’ve never raised a tax at all.
Ron DeSantis (15:36):
You tried.
Nikki Haley (15:36):
I can tell you right—
Ron DeSantis (15:37):
You’re on video.
Dana Bash (15:38):
Governor DeSantis, she has the floor.
Nikki Haley (15:39):
So I can tell you that we killed the gas tax multiple times, but what we said is if you want to raise the gas tax, you have to reduce the income tax by five times that amount, they didn’t want to do it. We’ve killed taxes every step of the way, but if he’s going to talk about his economy, I think what we should say is, why does Florida have the highest property insurance in the country? Why is it that it is named the American hot spot for inflation? Why is it that his state is now known to have the highest cost of living increases? And why is it that they’re saying senior citizens can no longer afford to live in Florida? So that’s the first thing I’ll say, we don’t need him doing that to our country.
When it comes to the gas tax, when we eliminate that federal tax, the money is collected in the states and send it to the Feds, the Feds attach a lot of strings to it and send it back, 75% comes from the state, 25% comes from the federal government. What they do when they add those strings is, they pay for a lot of things that aren’t roads, green spaces, sidewalks, all of those things, but they attach strings. I want that money to stay in the states, I want the states to be able to decide how to spend it. I don’t want Washington bureaucrats deciding what we need for scenery and green space and all those other things, I want every state, including the state of Iowa to make the decisions on how they spend their road spending instead of the federal government.
Dana Bash (16:59):
Governor DeSantis your response.
Ron DeSantis (17:02):
She kind of admitted that she did try to raise the gas tax and she’s on video saying this. I know she’ll say it, she never said it, but she did.
Nikki Haley (17:12):
You snippet that—
Ron DeSantis (17:12):
She did do it.
Nikki Haley (17:12):
That is not true.
Ron DeSantis (17:12):
She also raised taxes—
Dana Bash (17:13):
Governor—
Nikki Haley (17:13):
You are lying again.
Dana Bash (17:13):
Governor Haley—
Ron DeSantis (17:14):
She raised taxes when she was in—
Dana Bash (17:15):
Governor DeSantis has the floor.
Ron DeSantis (17:15):
South Carolina, that’s on the record. And she even proposed a tax on groceries at one point. But I’m just thinking, have you seen your grocery bill lately? That’s one of the things that’s hitting working people the most, that groceries are going up probably twice as much what you do. But I also think it’s important that we lift people up, so in Florida, we eliminated all sales tax on every baby item, diapers, wipes, strollers, cribs, we want families to be able to prosper in this country. One of the things that’s causing so much problem is the breakdown in the American family. We’ve done a lot in Florida to be able to rejuvenate that, but we need to make it easier for people to raise children in this country so that we can have strong families and a strong country.
Dana Bash (18:00):
Governor DeSantis at a CNN town hall last week, you said you support a flat tax, which is a single income tax rate for every American. Under your plan, would working families pay the same tax rate as billionaires?
Ron DeSantis (18:13):
I would only do it if people are better off than they are now. I mean, I want people paying less taxes. Actually, if you think, the last year we have numbers for, the federal government took in the highest percentage of taxes from the economy since World War II, and yet they’re going deep into debt. We have a spending problem in this country, it’s not a tax problem in this country. And if you had something that was simple and transparent, not only would that be better for economic growth, it’s also better to end the weaponization of government. The IRS has been weaponized against conservatives, going back to the Obama administration, I was there for that. No one’s been held accountable for doing that.
You look at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the weaponization of federal power ends the day I become the president of the United States. There’s going to be a new sheriff in town, we’re going to restore the constitutional accountability that our founding fathers envisioned when they formatted the constitution. And I’ve talked to folks who have overbearing federal agencies, I mean, you have farmers who have the EPA coming on their farmland, because there’s maybe a puddle there, waters of the United States, give me a break. So we’re going to reduce the size of government, but we’re also going to reduce the scope of government. And in Florida, I’ve actually delivered on this. Florida has the lowest percentage of state government workers per capita in the country, and the cost of our state government employees is the lowest in the country. No wonder why we’re paying down debt while we’re cutting taxes for people. That’s the way you do it.
Dana Bash (19:45):
Governor DeSantis 15 second point of clarification. The question was, whether or not working families would pay the same amount—
Ron DeSantis (19:52):
They would pay—
Dana Bash (19:52):
As billionaires?
Ron DeSantis (19:53):
Less than what they’re paying now. The way I view it is, okay, and you’d exempt people, so you would pay no tax for working-class people. It would only be as you get above, because I think the first 40, 50 grand, that’s just to subsist and even some places you can’t even do that. So you would have no tax up to a certain point and then it would just be a single rate. So if somebody makes a hundred thousand dollars, they pay a certain amount, if someone makes 200,000, they make twice as much and they pay twice as much.
Dana Bash (20:17):
Thank you Governor DeSantis.
Ron DeSantis (20:18):
Twice as much and they pay twice as much.
Dana Bash (20:20):
Governor Haley, your response?
Nikki Haley (20:22):
I mean, first of all, you just can’t trust what he says, I mean, that’s the biggest thing. We don’t have a grocery tax in South Carolina and I never once raised taxes, period. But what I will tell you is, it is, to call into question, why did he promise he’d never raised the debt limit and he turned around and he raised it? And then you want to go and you see one side of what he says early on and then he changes it. So here he goes and he says that he is all for energy independence, he wants to get the EPA out of the way. Well, why did he run on the fact that he wanted to ban fracking and ban offshore drilling? Why did he go and author that legislation to eliminate the renewable fuel standard that matters so much? And why now is he suddenly coming to Iowa and saying, “Oh, nevermind, I don’t mean all of that?”
Why did he call Trump and say that he wanted him to stop drilling nine miles into federal waters? Why is he now saying this? Why do you come to the people of Iowa and say one thing when you campaigned and on day two of your office, you banned fracking, you banned offshore drilling, you turned around and authored and led the charge on banning the Renewable Fuel Standard.
Dana Bash (21:27):
Thank you Governor.
Ron DeSantis (21:28):
Yeah, well—
Nikki Haley (21:29):
You’ve got to stand up for those things that you did.
Ron DeSantis (21:31):
You’ve been beating that dead horse, that’s been debunked—
Nikki Haley (21:33):
Because it’s true Ron.
Ron DeSantis (21:34):
Multiple times.
Nikki Haley (21:35):
It’s true.
Ron DeSantis (21:35):
We’re looking forward to be able to open up energy for production and definitely here in the Midwest with biofuels, I’m the only one that checked all the boxes from the Iowa Renewable Fuel Standard, because I’ve actually visited all 99 counties. I’ve actually shown up to people’s farm, I’ve sat and I’ve listened to people about what they’re going through, how their economy is structured and how it’s important that we’re producing energy here in the United States. I never want to go hat in hand like Biden has done, to Venezuela or Saudi and begging for energy. We’re going to be able to open up production, we’re going to choose Midland over Moscow, we’re going to choose the Marcellus Shale over the Mullas and we’re going to choose the Bakken over Beijing.
Energy independence, it’s good for consumers, it’s good to reduce inflation and it’s one of the best things we can do for our national security. So we’ll do that on day one and we are going to reverse Biden’s Green New Deal and the Electric Vehicle Mandates will save the American automobile.
Jake Tapper (22:30):
Thank you Governor. This has been one of the biggest years for illegal border crossings into the United States. Last month alone, 225,000 migrants illegally crossed the southern border, it’s a record high, overwhelming the border patrol resources that are already stretched thin. Mayors across the country say their cities are being pushed to a breaking point. Governor DeSantis, former President Trump famously promised to build a wall on the southern border, he obviously did not get that done. You have promised to finish the job. How will you succeed where he failed?
Ron DeSantis (23:02):
We will build the wall, we will actually have Mexico pay for it in the way that I thought Donald Trump was. We’re going to charge fees on remittances that workers send to foreign countries. Billions of dollars will build the wall. He also promised record deportations. Donald Trump deported fewer people than Barack Obama did when he was president. Biden’s let in 8 million people just in four years, they all have to go back. We have to enforce the rule of law in this country. Think about what’s happening to our country, just this week we saw the news that a school in Brooklyn, New York had the kids stay home. They were not able to go to school, told you can’t go get an in-person education, why? Because the city’s commandeering the school to house illegal aliens in it. Talk about putting Americans last. You’re putting these kids out of an education because you can’t control the border.
Biden has failed in this endeavor, he has not taken care that the laws of this country be faithfully executed. Do not trust Nikki Haley with illegal immigration, that’s like having the fox guard the hen house. She’s on tape at the Aspen Institute, she’ll say she didn’t say it. She was chastising conservatives, saying it’s disrespectful to illegal aliens to say that they’re criminals. They’re violating the law, it’s disrespectful when people come to this country illegally and impose burdens on our communities and run drugs into this country, that’s what’s disrespectful. She’s weak on immigration, she’s bankrolled by people who want open borders and she said there shouldn’t be a limit on immigration, you should work with corporate [inaudible 00:24:34].
Jake Tapper (24:33):
Thanks Governor.
Ron DeSantis (24:34):
That is pale pastels. That is—
Jake Tapper (24:35):
Governor.
Ron DeSantis (24:35):
Warmed over corporatism.
Jake Tapper (24:36):
Thank you so much. So Governor Haley—
Nikki Haley (24:38):
Wooo.
Jake Tapper (24:41):
Governor DeSantis and also Donald Trump are attacking you for that comment in 2015 in which you said undocumented immigrants should not be called, “criminals.” At the time the full context is you said, “We don’t need to talk about them as criminals, they’re not, they’re families that want a better life and they’re desperate to get here.” Do you still feel that way?
Nikki Haley (24:59):
I saw them. When I was at the United Nations, I saw them, that doesn’t mean we should let them into our country. I mean, first of all, I will tell you that when I was governor of South Carolina, we passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country, Obama sued us over it and we won. We fought Obama on illegal immigration, we fought Obama on migrant kids, we fought Obama on Syrian refugees, we fought Obama on Guantanamo Bay prisoners. I have always said we are a country of laws, the second we stop being a country of laws, we give up everything this country was founded on.
But I will tell you in passing that toughest illegal immigration law in the country, we passed E-Verify, which I want to take national, which is where businesses have to prove that the people they hire are in this country legally. I passed it within six months of being governor, Ron didn’t pass it for five years, he only waited to pass it when he decided to run for president. What we need to do is not just ban a wall, we need to put 25,000 border patrol and ICE agents on the ground and let them do their job. We need to defund sanctuary cities once and for all, no more safe havens for illegal immigrants.
We need to make sure we go back to the Remain in Mexico policy so that no one even steps foot on US soil and instead of catch and release, we need to go to catch and deport. That’s the only way we’ll stop the incentives of these illegal immigrants coming across. Biden turned around and gave half a million Venezuelans temporary protective status. That’s half a million driver’s licenses, half a million social security numbers, all that does is incentivize them to pick up the phone—
Jake Tapper (26:31):
Thank you Governor.
Nikki Haley (26:31):
Call their family members—
Ron DeSantis (26:31):
She—
Nikki Haley (26:31):
And tell them—
Jake Tapper (26:32):
Thank you governor, Governor DeSantis.
Nikki Haley (26:33):
To come on ahead.
Ron DeSantis (26:35):
When she was governor, she did bring Syrian refugees and she got criticized for that.
Nikki Haley (26:39):
That is not true.
Ron DeSantis (26:40):
She also in her comment—
Nikki Haley (26:40):
DeSantisLies.com.
Ron DeSantis (26:40):
When she says—
Jake Tapper (26:42):
Hold on one second governor, we’ll—
Nikki Haley (26:43):
That is not true.
Jake Tapper (26:44):
We’ll give you your turn in a second.
Ron DeSantis (26:45):
She get it—
Jake Tapper (26:45):
Governor DeSantis.
Ron DeSantis (26:46):
It’s noted. So—
Nikki Haley (26:46):
It’s unbelievable.
Ron DeSantis (26:48):
The disrespect comment, she’s talking about that they’re all families, if you look right now at the border, these are military-age males many of them. And they’re coming from all across this world, not just from Central American fact, you’ve got them from China, Iran, Russia, the Middle East. When I was down there a couple of years ago, because I’ve sent people down there, you had people from Libya and Haiti. This is a ticking time bomb for this country. They’re of course going to be terrorist cells that have come in. It’s like the lowest cost way to be able to harm this country, just send people across the southern border. Nikki Haley also opposed the border wall in 2016. She ridiculed it when Donald Trump was pertinent. I’m telling you, you need a wall. You can’t trust politicians to do this. If the wall’s there, it’s a physical fact of life and it’s a huge step—
Jake Tapper (27:35):
Thank you, Governor DeSantis.
Ron DeSantis (27:36):
… to restoring this country’s sovereignty.
Jake Tapper (27:37):
Thank you, Governor DeSantis. Governor Haley.
Nikki Haley (27:38):
Go to desantislies.com. I said, you can’t just build a wall. You have to do more than build a wall. It was having the wall and everything else. You can’t trust what Ron’s saying. But this is a bigger issue, this is more than him just constantly being desperate and throwing things on me. This is the fact that we have to realize my parents came here legally. They came the right way 50 years ago. They put in the time, they put in the price. They are offended by what’s happening on the border.
And my mom would always say, “If they don’t follow the laws to come into this country, they won’t follow the laws when they are in this country.” And we have to start treating this like it is. This is putting harm on our schools, on our hospitals, taxpayers are paying for it. You see, these mayors are now upset about it. The only reason Eric Adams is now upset, why? He shouldn’t be a sanctuary city then, that’s why we have to defund sanctuary cities. Now, Governor Abbott finally did to them what’s been happening to Texas for so long. We’ve got to put an end to this, it’s dangerous and it doesn’t even count the fentanyl that’s coming across.
Jake Tapper (28:42):
Thank you, governor. Governor DeSantis. There are more than 10 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States according to Pew Research. Will any of them be allowed to stay in the United States under your administration?
Ron DeSantis (28:57):
The number of people that will be amnestied when I’m president is zero. We cannot do an amnesty in this country. First of all, all it’s going to do is cause more people to want to come illegally. So you’ve got to enforce the law, it’s got to be consistent, people got to know it’s there. You also have to remove benefits for people who are here illegally. California, you can go illegal alien and you get free health insurance coverage. You’re here illegally and they’re doing that. We should not let states provide these benefits. In Florida, obviously we don’t do that, we don’t allow the driver’s license and all that, but some states do and it creates a magnet for people coming in.
So federally, no benefits, no enticements to come in. And then the states, we’re going to crack down on sanctuary states and sanctuary cities. And I showed the hypocrisy of all this back in 2022. Because we have a program to transport illegal aliens to sanctuary jurisdictions and one of the places we sent 50 to, beautiful, liberal Martha’s Vineyard. And you know what? These are folks that were on their high horse saying how they were a sanctuary jurisdiction, saying nobody’s illegal, all refugees are welcome. That’s what they had in their town. The minute even 50 came up, they called a state of emergency and deported them off the island the next day. How do you think Texas feels? How do you think all these other communities feel that are being overwhelmed? So we cannot have liberal elites in this country imposing policies on the rest of us that they are not willing to deal with the consequences of themselves.
Jake Tapper (30:27):
Governor Haley, when you’re president, will any of the more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in the US be allowed to stay in the country under your administration?
Nikki Haley (30:37):
You have to deport them. And the reason you have to deport them is they’re cutting the line. You’ve got people who have done this and tried to go through the right way. You can’t have them go and jump the line and suddenly do that. And that is actually what will get them to stop coming is when they do realize they get to the wall and they have to turn around and go back. It’s a dangerous process of what happens for them to try and migrate here.
But when I was at the United Nations and we had this, which is another reason why we need to have Trump here defending himself and talking about what he would do going in the future because it’s a problem. I was on the ground in Honduras and Guatemala and what we saw is a lot of the reason why they were coming from there is because of gangs and drugs. And so what we did was we had our military go and train them on how to deal with gangs. We went and put drug boats on the water to keep the drugs from coming. But we said, “You have to have them processed from here. You can’t have them come.” We were able to stop that flow. We’ve got to go back to do that, but we need to end it once and for all. Donald Trump didn’t do that, that’s why he needs to be here debating on the stage right now.
Dana Bash (31:39):
Governor, thank you. Let’s turn to foreign policy. You have expressed different visions for how the US should approach the international conflicts. And I want to start with Ukraine. It’s been nearly two years since Russia invaded Ukraine and there is still no end in sight to that war. Governor Haley, you say that this is a, “War about freedom, that Ukraine must win.” Governor DeSantis says, “We need to bring this war to an end.” Do you believe he shares your commitment to a Ukrainian victory?
Nikki Haley (32:09):
Nobody knows what he believes because when President Obama was in office, he supported foreign aid to Ukraine. Now he’s copying Trump and trying to act like he doesn’t want to support Ukraine. But let me tell you why Ukraine should matter. First of all, I don’t think we should give cash to any country, friend or foe, because you can’t follow it, you can’t hold it accountable. I don’t think we need to put troops on the ground and Ukrainians want to win this themselves. But dictators always do what they say they’re going to do. China said they were going to take Hong Kong. They did. Russia said they were going to invade Ukraine. We watched it. China says, Taiwan is next. We better believe them. Russia said once they take Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. Those are NATO countries and that puts America at war.
This is about preventing war. It’s always been about preventing war. If we support Ukraine, that’s only 3.5% of our defense budget. Biden and no one else is telling the American people the truth about that. The Europeans have put in more than that and they should, it’s their neighborhood. But this is a pro-American, freedom loving country and we better remember that you have to be a friend to get a friend. And we needed a lot of friends September 12th. We’ve got to make sure that we’re having the backs of the right friends because if Russia wins, China wins. There’s a reason the Taiwanese want us to help the Ukrainians and that’s because they know if Ukraine wins, China won’t invade Taiwan. This is about preventing war.
Dana Bash (33:34):
Governor DeSantis.
Ron DeSantis (33:41):
I supported Trump’s policy vis-a-vis Russia, Ukraine and it was successful. The Biden policy has not been, but Nikki Haley is basically a carbon copy of what Biden is. It’s an open-ended commitment, they want another $108 billion, they will not tell you when they have achieved their goal and this is going to go on maybe hundreds of billions more into the future. I think a lot of people have died, we need to find a way to end this.
Because our priority is for national security, of course the border, which we talked about, and people like Nikki Haley care more about Ukraine’s border than she does about our own southern border, which is wrong. But we also have to look at what’s the top threat to this country, it’s the Chinese Communist Party. We are not doing what we need to do to have adequate hard power in the Indo-Pacific and here’s the thing, we don’t have enough resources being $35 trillion in debt to continue doing hundreds of billions of dollars. We’ve got to focus on our issues here at home and we’ve got to deal with the top threat that we face, which is China.
Nikki Haley (34:40):
And then I wonder why you raised the debt when you were in Congress because we’re all paying for that. What I will tell you is this is the lie they’re telling the American people over and over again. It is so wrong to say this. They’re saying you have to choose between Ukraine or Israel, or Israel and securing the border. Supporting Ukraine is 3.5% of our budget. I don’t want cash going, it’s equipment and it’s ammunition. If we support Ukraine and Israel, that’s only 5% of our defense budget.
Ron DeSantis (35:09):
So you’re going to borrow that?
Nikki Haley (35:10):
If we support Ukraine, Israel and secure the border, that’s less than 20% of Biden’s green subsidies. You do not have to choose when it comes to national security. This is about keeping Americans safe, this is about preventing war, this is about keeping our military men and women from having to fight a war. And you only do that when you focus on national security, not telling lies to the American people that they have to choose, that is wrong. That’s never been the case.
Dana Bash (35:42):
Governor DeSantis.
Ron DeSantis (35:42):
Here’s the problem with what she’s saying. She doesn’t articulate how this comes to an end except she was asked after the last debate by, I believe Megan Kelly, and she said, “You bring it to an end by bringing Ukraine into NATO.” But of course, we’re a NATO country, so if you bring Ukraine into NATO, that puts the United States at war. Megan said that to her and then she basically gave a word salad as to how you go from there. So they have sent cash. She supports this $106 billion that they’re trying to get through Congress. Where’s some of that money going? They’ve done tens of billions of dollars to pay salaries for Ukrainian government bureaucrats. They’ve paid pensions for Ukrainian retirees with your tax dollars. We’ve got homeless veterans. We have all these problems. This is the UN way of thinking that we’re somehow globalists and we have unlimited resources to do. I think here’s the problem. You can take the ambassador out of the United Nations, but you can’t take the United Nations out of the ambassador.
Nikki Haley (36:42):
First of all, I have never said that we should give salaries or benefits or anything else to Ukrainians. I have said it again, Ron, so stop lying. Desantislies.com
Ron DeSantis (36:51):
But you supported the aid packages.
Dana Bash (36:53):
Governor DeSantis, she has the floor.
Nikki Haley (36:54):
So I did not support the aid package, I support equipment and ammunition going to Ukraine. I think it is incredibly important that we’re honest and say we have to focus on national security. Don’t go and lie to the American people to make them think we can’t do this. You turn around and raise the debt limit, you’re the one that’s talked about… Look at what you did to Florida, but think about the fact that he’s talking about where’s this money going to come from? The best way to tell about a candidate is to see how they’ve run their campaign. He has blown through $150 million, I don’t even know how you do that, through his campaign and he has nothing to show for it. He’s spent more money on private planes than he has on commercials trying to get Iowans to vote for him. If you can’t manage a campaign, how are you going to manage a country? Which is exactly what [inaudible 00:37:41].
Ron DeSantis (37:40):
Well listen, I’m proud that in the state of Florida we’re ranked number one for economy of all 50 states by CNBC, number one for education—
Nikki Haley (37:50):
Highest cost of living.
Ron DeSantis (37:51):
She was ranked number 50 in education when she was Governor of California—
Nikki Haley (37:56):
Highest insurance.
Dana Bash (37:57):
Governor Haley, he has the floor.
Ron DeSantis (37:57):
And course she wasn’t able to do school choice. She didn’t deliver big tax cuts. We’re also number one for net in migration, number one for GDP growth amongst large states, number one for talent development, number one for new business formations and on and on it goes. So the success we’ve had in Florida, I can cite the statistics, it’s important, but just look how people are voting with their feet. They’re leaving California, they’re leaving Illinois, New York, all these states, and they’re coming to Florida in record numbers because we’re doing it right. And not only have I cut taxes big time, where she didn’t in Governor of South Carolina, we’ve paid down 25% of our state’s debt. That’s how you manage the third-largest state in this country. Just imagine if we could do that for the United States of America.
Jake Tapper (38:39):
So thank you. Let’s stay on foreign policy. I want to turn to the Israel-Hamas war. You both have said that you unequivocally support Israel. You both have called for the complete elimination of Hamas. Governor DeSantis, there are real disagreements within Israel about how to handle what happens in Gaza after the war against Hamas is over. Some Israeli cabinet officials are pushing for the mass removal of Palestinians from Gaza. Governor Haley told CNN last week, she does not support that, do you?
Ron DeSantis (39:08):
So we’ve got to support Israel, in word and in deed, in public and in private. And they need to be able to finish the job. Joe Biden is knee capping them. He’ll say one thing, then he goes, and his base doesn’t like Israel, so he’s got to do all these other things. This is a time to recognize that they suffered the most murder of Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas wants a second Holocaust. They want to annihilate the state of Israel. So I think to be a good ally, you back them in the decisions that they’re making with respect to Gaza. Look, there’s a lot of pluses and minuses with how you’re doing this, but for us to be sitting in Washington second guessing them, I don’t think that’s the right way.
We also have a disagreement, Governor Haley and I, when she was at the UN, she supported the idea of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs. The problem with that is the Palestinian Arabs don’t recognize Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. So doing a two-state solution doesn’t create something that’s going to lead to a lasting piece, it creates a stepping stone for Israel’s destruction. So under no circumstances as president, am I going to pressure Israel to risk their security to do a so-called two-state solution. She was wrong when she embraced that and we’re right to say we trust Israel to make these decisions. They’re a good ally of ours, we should trust their judgment on these sensitive issues.
Jake Tapper (40:27):
Governor DeSantis, 15 second clarification. Do you support the mass removal of Palestinians from Gaza?
Ron DeSantis (40:35):
So as president, I am not going to tell them to do that. I think there’s a lot of issues with that. But if they make the calculation that to avert a second Holocaust, they need to do that. I think some of these Palestinian Arabs, Saudi Arabia should take some, Egypt should take some. They’ve never been willing to accept any of these folks in their own neighborhood.
Jake Tapper (40:53):
Thank you, governor. Governor Haley.
Nikki Haley (40:54):
Well, first of all, we need to understand that the reason we need to support Israel is Israel’s a bright spot in a tough neighborhood. They’re the tip of the spear when it comes to defeating terrorism. It has never been that Israel needs America, it has always been that America needs Israel. When I was at the United Nations, I fought every day for Israel. And if you would’ve listened to what I said at the United Nations, a two-state solution wasn’t something that was possible because Israel would always come to the table and the Palestinians wouldn’t.
But right now we have to make sure that Israel has the support that it needs. There should be three things. Give Israel whatever it wants to get the job done. Two, eliminate Hamas once and for all. And three, do whatever it takes to bring the hostages home. But it’s really rich that Ron is going to act like he suddenly cares for Israel when he brought the person to Iowa, that’s the most anti-Israel Republican in the state, the person that went and voted against Israel’s right to exist in Congress, the person that voted with the squad against antisemitism on college campuses.
Jake Tapper (41:57):
Thank you, governor.
Nikki Haley (41:57):
And you brought that person—
Jake Tapper (41:58):
Thank you, governor.
Nikki Haley (41:59):
… to Iowa to go and campaign with you. If that’s your friend, I’d hate to see who the rest of your friends are.
Jake Tapper (42:04):
Governor DeSantis, she’s obviously referring to Congressman Tom Massie from Kentucky.
Ron DeSantis (42:07):
That’s just cheap garbage. But here’s the thing. When the attacks happened against Israel, I knew it was going to be a big deal for Florida. We have one of the largest Israeli American populations in the country and we’ve been a haven for Orthodox Jews in particular since I’ve been governor. And you know what? Biden wasn’t helping Americans get out of the war zone. These are people that were stranded. So I did an executive order, we scrambled planes and we rescued over 700 Americans from Israel and brought them back safely to the state of Florida. You’ve got to step up and you’ve got to lead when things like this are happening.
We also have gone after the antisemitism on our campuses. We did that early in my administration. You didn’t see our college presidents doing some of the things that you’ve seen. I just announced in the State of the State Address yesterday or two days ago that we are going to say, and not just for Jewish students, anyone who’s being persecuted or being marginalized because of their faith in any college around the country, we’re going to waive the transfer requirements so that people can come to Florida and be safe. What they are doing to these Jewish governor students has been reprehensible—
Jake Tapper (43:09):
Thank you, governor.
Ron DeSantis (43:09):
… and we’re not going to let it happen.
Jake Tapper (43:12):
I’m coming to you. There are growing fears of this war escalating into a broader regional conflict. And Governor Haley, just yesterday, the US Navy shot down 21 missiles and drones fired by Iranian backed militants in the Red Sea. Iranian backed militants are now also attacking US and Western interests in Syria and Iraq. Your fellow South Carolinian Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is calling for the US to conduct retaliatory strikes inside Iran. Would you order strikes inside Iran?
Nikki Haley (43:40):
Well, first of all, notice Ron didn’t say anything about the fact that he did bring the most anti-Israel Republican into this state to campaign. He also hasn’t told you that the only Republican Jewish state legislator left his campaign because he wasn’t dealing with the neo-Nazi marches and wasn’t dealing with antisemitism properly. When it comes to Iran, what we have to understand, there would be no Hamas without Iran, there would not be Houthis without Iran, there wouldn’t be Hezbollah without Iran. And when you look at the strikes that are happening in Iraq and Syria, that is because of Iran. They’re pulling the puppet strings. What we need to do is the idea that we’ve had over 130 strikes on our men and women in Iraq and Syria is unconscionable. We’re supposed to have their backs. And Biden has been slow, he’s been hiding in a corner and he hasn’t dealt with it.
We need to go and take out every bit of the production that they have that’s allowing them to do those strikes. It’s hugely important that we do that. And you can’t do that if you have a Secretary of Defense that is in ICU and the president doesn’t even know about it. What bothers me is how does Biden not talk to his Secretary of Defense every single day knowing that we have a war in Europe, a war in the Middle East, that we have our American military with strikes going on them, we’ve got brain injuries. My husband is deployed right now. As a military spouse, the idea that the Secretary of Defense would not even be in contact with the president, much less in contact with his staff, is unforgivable.
Jake Tapper (45:10):
Governor DeSantis.
Ron DeSantis (45:14):
After the attacks against Israel, anyone with half a brain knows Iran is behind this. They fund Hamas, they fund Hezbollah. We did a special session of legislature down in Florida. We expanded sanctions against Iran. If we were our own country, we’d be the 14th largest economy in the world. The root of this is Biden came into office and he relaxed the sanctions on Iran. They’ve had massive amounts of money flooding into their country just like under the Obama Administration. They take that money and they use it to fund Jihad around the world. I’m the only one running for president that’s served in the armed forces. I deployed to Iraq back in 2007, 2008, so I understand what our military goes through. I would never put our troops in harm’s way, like Biden is doing in the Middle East, without defending them with everything they got. If you harm a hair on the head of one of our service members, you are going to have hell to pay. He’s leaving them out to dry and I think it’s disgraceful for a Commander in Chief to do that.
Jake Tapper (46:11):
Thank you, governor. The CNN Republican Presidential Debate live from Des Moines, Iowa will be right back after this. Go to cnn.com for real time debate analysis. Stay with us.
Dana Bash (46:20):
Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate, live from Iowa, Drake University. Let’s start this with healthcare. Neither of you has released a detailed healthcare plan, so we want to give the voters here some insight into specifics of what you might do as president. Governor Haley, as governor of South Carolina, you chose not to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. 40 states, including this one where we are in Iowa, did expand Medicaid covering more than 18 million Americans. As president, would you allow those states to keep their expansions in place?
Nikki Haley (47:09):
Well, the first thing is we have to look at the fact that how can we be the best country in the world with the most expensive healthcare in the world? So the way we’re going to deal with it is we’re going to open it all up from the hospitals to the insurance companies, to the doctor’s offices, to the pharmaceuticals, to the PBMs, make them have to show us everything. Right now I can tell you, we take care of my parents. They’re 87 and 90. My dad is in the hospital right now. When my mom was in the hospital, a nurse came up to her to give her a couple of Tylenol and she said, “I don’t need them.” She said, “Honey, you might as well take them because you’re going to pay for them anyway.” When we got the bill from the hospital, no one talked to us about that.
Right now you have insurance companies and hospitals deciding what it is for us. We’re going to take the patient out of the backseat and put them in the driver’s seat. We’re going to make sure that just like when you get your car fixed and you go and they say, “We can give you a temporary fix and it’ll cost this much money. Or we can give you a permanent fix and it’s going to cost that much money,” we’re going to go and make it transparent so that we can see everything so that they have to show us their warts.
The second thing is we’re going to pass tort reform around this country. I did that in South Carolina. Doctors don’t give you those 10 tests because they want to. It’s for the 90% chance they’ll get sued. Then we’re going to go and eliminate certificate of need in this country. I did that in South Carolina as well. That basically says if you have a hospital here, you can’t have another hospital for X number of miles. They do the same thing for surgical centers, for nursing homes. We’re going to put competition back in healthcare so that healthcare is fighting for the patient, that way services go up and costs go down.
Dana Bash (48:44):
Governor Haley, just a 15-second point of clarification. Would you allow the states that accepted Medicaid expansion to keep that?
Nikki Haley (48:52):
So the problem with Medicaid is, it needs to be sent down as block grants. Governors can best decide how to do that, whether they need to use it towards mental health, whether they need to use it towards support services. Right now, I would send all of that down to the states. The problem is, they’re only sending a small portion of it. They need to send more of that so the states can better take care of it.
Dana Bash (49:12):
Thank you, Governor Haley. Governor DeSantis, your response on whether you would allow Iowa and the other 39 states who accepted Medicaid expansion to keep it.
Ron DeSantis (49:20):
Well, I’ve spoken with a lot of folks here in Iowa and we need healthcare that’s accessible, that’s affordable, and that’s accountable and particularly an emphasis on mental health. In every corner of this state, everywhere I’ve traveled in the campaign, people are really concerned about mental health. With the kids in schools, people that are coming out of service to our country, with veterans, we’re going to put a big emphasis on mental health.
I’ve actually delivered on some of these things in Florida, we got accountability for the pharmacy benefit middlemen that are causing your drug prices to go up, so we have transparency and consumers pay less. I just beat the federal government to allow the state of Florida to buy prescription drugs from Canada, which is 25 cents on the dollar what our prescription drugs cost. I want seniors to be able to do. Then finally, we need to upend this COVID and medical authoritarian regime that we saw going around this country during COVID. It’s wrong to force vaxes like the COVID shot and say people are going to lose their jobs. That is not going to ever happen on my watch, trust me.
Dana Bash (50:26):
Governor DeSantis, same 15-second clarification.
Ron DeSantis (50:27):
I think what you do is you block grant the program and then let states run the way they see fit to do. I can tell you this, expanding Medicaid leads to less private coverage. It doesn’t necessarily increase access to quality care. I want to actually people get good healthcare. It’s not just about a best sheet of paper if you don’t get any good doctors that [inaudible 01:30:48] for that.
Dana Bash (50:49):
Thank you, Governor. Governor DeSantis mentioned mental health. Let’s talk about that. There is a mental health crisis in this country. An estimated 58 million Americans suffer from some type of mental illness. Governor Haley, you say the mental health crisis is a quote, “Cancer that no one has dealt with.” What do you think is causing the crisis and what would you do to fix it?
Nikki Haley (51:09):
Well, I think we saw it exacerbated by COVID. I mean with the school lockdowns and everything else, we see young people now with more anxiety, stress, and depression than ever before. One in three people right now suffer from mental health issues, but if treated, they can live a perfectly normal life. The problem is we don’t have enough mental health therapists. We don’t have enough mental health treatment centers. We don’t have enough addiction centers. If you happen to be lucky enough to get one of those three, insurance doesn’t cover it.
We have got to start dealing with this because it’s become a huge issue. That’s why we need to have more telehealth so that people can get the mental health care they need right when they need it. We need to have mental health counselors in schools so they can identify when a child has a problem that they can get the help that they need. Right now we’ve got to get access to care and that’s again why I want to move those federal programs down to the state level because states know they need more mental health support. They’re not getting the dollars to do it. We don’t need DC bureaucrats handling that. We need this on the ground so that we can get the mental health centers, get the therapists, and get the help that people need so that they can be healthy again.
Dana Bash (52:15):
Governor DeSantis, you said right here in Iowa this summer that closing mental health institutions, a policy supported by Ronald Reagan, was a mistake. As president, would you restore federal funding to those mental health institutions?
Ron DeSantis (52:29):
Yes, we need more people in institutionalized settings unfortunately. Governor Haley mentioned, I think correctly the devastating mental health consequences for these school closures, a lot of things that happened during COVID, I never recalled seeing her out there fighting the fight. I was on the front lines on that. Governor Kim Reynolds was on the front lines on that. We fought back against the biomedical state. We were attacked by the media. We were attacked by the pharmaceutical companies. We were attacked by the left, attacked by Fauci. We stood and we helped people. Iowa and Florida had the best schools opening in the entire pandemic because we led. That’s what you want to do.
Now in terms of mental health, I’ve run into veterans here in Iowa and I think we have a significant problem with veterans, particularly the post 9/11 veterans and we know the stats on suicide. It’s really, really sad. As a fellow veteran, as president, I have to put that issue on the front burner. We can’t keep turning a blind eye to what’s happening to our vets. It’s not going to be done just through the VA and it can’t be done just by pumping people with pharmaceuticals. If a veteran has post-traumatic stress, you need more than just that.
So we’re going to use the VA to link veterans with resources that are throughout our country. For example, in Florida, we have an organization that trains service dogs to be able to be paired with veterans with post-traumatic stress. They understand the symptoms, they mitigate it, and you know what? The suicide rate is close to zero as a result of that. We got to think bigger than these bureaucracies and we’ve got to be there for our vets and their mental health.
Jake Tapper (53:40):
Thank you, Governor. Turning to the topic of climate, 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded on earth and Americans are already feeling the impact. Just yesterday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the US experienced 28 weather and climate related disasters that cost at least $1 billion last year, another record. Governor DeSantis here in Florida… I’m sorry. Governor DeSantis, here in Iowa, massive flooding has left farmers underwater. In Florida, rising seas threatened coastal cities. You have taken action in your home state to mitigate the problems of rising seas, but as president, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause, which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions.
Ron DeSantis (54:45):
So on day one, as president, we take Biden’s Green New Deal, we tear it up and we throw it in the trash can. It is bad for this country. We have to have reliable energy. Here’s the thing. They talk about… Joe Biden has said that global warming is worse than a nuclear war. I’m just thinking to myself, well, gee, John Kerry hasn’t given up his private jet. Obama hasn’t given up his Martha’s Vineyard seaside mansion. I haven’t seen Biden do anything to hold China accountable except making sure that Hunter gets his money. So these guys talk out of one side of their mouth and then they behave in another way. I think that’s wrong. I also think that those policies would devastate communities, particularly here in Iowa.
For example, he wants to mandate electric vehicles. That’s going to be more costly. I think the car companies would go bankrupt, but it’s going to hurt liquid fuels, which is very, very important. You’re going to end up having rolling blackouts if they kneecap reliable energy production in this country. Florida’s had a massive decline in emissions, wasn’t because of a single mandate, it was because of innovation, because a lot of natural gas has replaced coal. We do have market-based solar and it’s a complement, but we cannot walk away from reliable energy. I think about, here’s what the left wants to do. They want to take away your freedom and they want you to pay more for everything. We need you to pay less for energy and we need to make sure people can innovate. We cannot have these mandates and they’ll be gone the day I’m president.
Jake Tapper (56:12):
So Governor, just a point of clarification, 15 seconds. Recent research at the University of Iowa ties these floods in Iowa to the rise in greenhouse gases.
Ron DeSantis (56:22):
Here’s the thing…
Jake Tapper (56:23):
Let me just ask the question. As president, would you do anything to deal with this underlying cause?
Ron DeSantis (56:28):
Innovate, and here’s the thing. China is building two coal plants a week. You can do everything Biden wants to do and you’re going to have way more of what China’s increasing it. So why would we be cutting off our nose to spite our face? China is the problem here, and so hold them accountable.
Jake Tapper (56:45):
Thank you, Governor.
Ron DeSantis (56:46):
Don’t hold the American people [inaudible 01:36:48].
Jake Tapper (56:48):
Governor Haley, as president, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause of the floods and other climate disasters which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions?
Nikki Haley (56:58):
I mean, first of all, regardless of what party, everybody wants to have clean air, clean water. They want a world that they can pass on to their kids that’s going to be healthy and all of that, but it’s how do we do that? I think the first thing we have to understand is you don’t deal in extremes. When I was at the United Nations, the reason I took us out of the Paris Climate Agreement was because President Obama had put all these mandates down on our businesses, but they didn’t do anything to hold China and India to account. Those are the two countries we have to really go to if we care about the environment that we go and make them be held accountable.
The second thing is we’ll roll back all of Biden’s green subsidies because they’re misplaced. Rather than putting anything towards innovation on what we can do on nuclear fusion and other things that reduce emissions, which there are things out there, to go and have everybody have to drive an electric car by 2035, that’s not even smart. One because, which by the way, Ron took Biden’s stimulus money and did charging stations all throughout Florida. I wouldn’t have taken the stimulus money, but what that does is basically we don’t have the infrastructure.
I’m not just talking about charging stations. Electric vehicles are heavy. Our roads and bridges wouldn’t be able to handle that if we did that because they’re heavy in weight. So we have to be smart about the way we do that. Not to mention 70% of the batteries in electric cars are made in China. So Biden gave this massive windfall to our number one national security threat. If we’re going to do it, innovate it, transition and do it the right way, not in extremes.
Dana Bash (58:32):
Thank you. I want to turn to the issue of crime. The majority of Americans describe crime in the US as either extremely or very serious. Recent data show crime rates falling, but some violent crime rates do remain high. Governor Haley, former President Trump suggested that he might try to stop violent crime by deploying US troops to Democratic run states and cities, something he could potentially do under the Insurrection Act. Is that something that you would do as president?
Nikki Haley (59:00):
What I would do is first of all, defund sanctuary cities. It’s hugely important that we do that. That’s where we’re seeing a lot of crime. The second thing is our law enforcement is demoralized right now because if they go and they arrest someone for having a stolen gun, it’s demoralizing when they go through all that effort, put their lives at risk and then you turn around and let that criminal go the very next day. Prosecutors need to prosecute according to the law, and we’ve got to start holding them accountable.
When we bring law and order back to our cities, then that’s when they’ll be safe. You don’t do it by defunding the police and you don’t do it by just praising the police. You do it by having their backs. We passed the first body camera bill in the country in South Carolina to make sure that law enforcement felt like they could do their job without anyone… Without feeling threatened about them doing their job. We have to have prosecutors prosecuting. We have to defund sanctuary cities. We have to get these stolen guns and drugs off the street, and the only way we can do that is when we empower law enforcement.
Ron DeSantis (01:00:03):
I just think, I mean that quote from the president, former President Trump is a little bit rich because he was president during the worst rioting in the modern history of this country, the BLM riots in the summer of 2020. When I saw that happen in Minneapolis, in Florida, I called out the National Guard. We had state law enforcement deployed. We said, “You’re not burning down our cities in this state.” You know what? It didn’t happen. He sat in the White House and tweeted law and order, but he did nothing to ensure law and order. As your president, I will never let our cities burn. You have every right to stop this runaway rioting as… In fact, you have a duty.
Now, Nikki Haley and I have a disagreement on the BLM stuff too because she tweeted during this period of time that the death of George Floyd should be, quote, “personal and painful for each and every American.” People in Iowa had nothing to do with that or Florida, or South Carolina. She was virtue signaling to the left. She was accepting the narrative and she was trying to impress people who were never going to like us. I never bought in to going after the police. We back the blue to the hilt in the state of Florida. We’re about lower crime as a result of that.
Dana Bash (01:01:12):
Thank you. Governor Haley.
Nikki Haley (01:01:15):
It’s interesting that he did that. He put a tweet that was very similar.
Ron DeSantis (01:01:19):
That’s not true.
Nikki Haley (01:01:19):
Let me tell you why he did that. First of all, we had one of the worst two racial shootings. We had the shooting of Walter Scott, who was shot seven times in the back by a dirty cop. We had a horrific shooting at a church where a white supremacist came in and killed nine amazing souls. BLM, all of that, we never had to deal with riots. We never had to call in the National Guard, Ron, because when we had both of those shootings, we were able to pull people together. We didn’t have riots, we had vigils. We didn’t have protests, we had prayer. We brought people together.
When I said that about George Floyd, when we turned around and had the worst shooting in a religious place that we had seen in this country, not only did I pass the first body camera bill in the country and keep our state together, not only did I move to bring the Confederate flag down. We came together as a state in prayer.
Jake Tapper (01:02:15):
Thank you, Governor.
Nikki Haley (01:02:16):
We had no division, no riots, no anything. We didn’t need the National Guard because a leader knows how to bring out the best of their people to go forward.
Jake Tapper (01:02:23):
Thank you, Governor. You have been sparring on the campaign trail for months. We’ve seen some vicious attack ads going back and forth, and tonight we have had a very lively debate. On a different note, Governor DeSantis, let me ask you, what do you admire about Governor Haley?
Ron DeSantis (01:02:41):
Well, look, I mean, I think that at the United Nations, I did think that she spoke out strongly on some key issues and I appreciated that. I also appreciate the state of South Carolina. My wife is a College of Charleston graduate. Her parents lived there for many, many years. So it is a wonderful state. There’s a lot of great people there, and I think to be able to have been governor there is a great achievement and I really appreciate everyone I’ve gotten to meet in South Carolina.
Jake Tapper (01:03:10):
Governor Haley, what do you admire about Governor DeSantis?
Nikki Haley (01:03:12):
I think he’s been a good governor.
Jake Tapper (01:03:16):
Okay, so we’re going to squeeze in another quick break and we’ll be right back with more from the Republican debates here at Drake University.
Dana Bash (01:03:28):
We are back live from Des Moines, Iowa and the CNN Republican Presidential Debate. We now have time for closing statements and we begin with Governor Haley.
Nikki Haley (01:03:56):
First of all, I want to thank the good people of Iowa. I have campaigned for 11 months, whether it’s driving a combine or holding a pig at a produce area, or whether it’s the fact that we’ve met owners of bakeries and small businesses. Every one of them knows that we can’t go through four more years of chaos. If it’s Donald Trump, there will be four more years of chaos. We can’t be a country in disarray in a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We can’t go through another nailbiter of an election. If you look at the polls right now, going against Joe Biden in every one of those head-to-head polls, Ron doesn’t beat Joe Biden. Trump is head-to-head. On a good day, he might be up by two points. I defeat Biden by 17 points.
That’s bigger than the presidency. That’s House, that’s Senate, that’s governorships, that’s down the school board. That’s a mandate to get our spending under control and get inflation down. That’s a mandate to get our kids reading again and go back to the basics in education. That’s a mandate to secure our borders with no more excuses. That’s a mandate to bring law and order back to our country, and that’s a mandate for a strong America that we can be proud of. We can do this. I know we can do this. If you will join with me in this movement, if you join with me in this fight, I promise you our best days are to come. God bless you.
Dana Bash (01:05:25):
Governor DeSantis.
Ron DeSantis (01:05:28):
Well, it’s been great to visit all 99 counties here in Iowa. I’ve been able to meet so many friends and really learn about some of the best of America. Iowa’s votes do not need to be corrected by any other state. You all know what you’re doing and we have an opportunity on Monday to really change the course of history. Donald Trump’s running for his issues. Nikki Haley’s running for her donor’s issues. I’m running for your issues, your family’s issues, and solely to turn this country around. I’m the only one running that’s delivered on 100% of my promises, and I’m the only one running that has beaten the left time and time again From the teacher’s unions to Fauci to the Democratic Party.
We need to run under the banner of bold colors that are putting the American people first. We can’t run under a banner of pale pastels of the warmed-over corporatism, the likes of which is practiced by Nikki Haley. Freedom is on the ballot. Decline is a choice. We have it within our power to fix this country and to turn it around. I am asking for your support in the Iowa Caucus on Monday, January 15th. I’ll be a president that you can be proud of and I promise you this, I will get the job done and I will not let you down. Thank you and God bless you all.
Jake Tapper (01:06:42):
