ANNOUNCER ([00:32]):
We are live from Georgia, a key battleground state in the race for the White House. In just moments, the current US president will debate the former US president as their party's presumptive nominees, a first in American history.

Dana Bash ([00:57]):
This debate is being produced by CNN and is coming to you live on CNN, CNN International, cnn.com, CNN Max and CNN Espanol. This is a pivotal moment between President Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump in their rematch for the nation's highest office. Each will make his case to the American people with just over four months until election day. Good evening, I'm Dana Bash, anchor of CNN's Inside Politics and co-anchor of State of the Union.

Jake Tapper ([01:28]):
I'm Jake Tapper, anchor of CNN's The Lead and co-anchor of State of the Union. Dana and I will co-moderate this evening. Our job is to facilitate a debate between the two candidates tonight. Before we introduce them, we want to share the rules of the debate with the audience at home. Former President Trump will be on the left side of the screen, President Biden will be appearing on the right, a coin toss determined their positions.

[STAGE DIRECTION: Candidates enter from opposite sides]

Dana Bash ([02:05]):
When it's time for a candidate to speak, his microphone will be turned on and his opponent's microphone will be turned off.

Jake Tapper ([02:40]):
Now, please welcome the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden.

Joe Biden ([02:47]):
Folks, how are you? Nice to be here, thanks.

Jake Tapper ([02:57]):
And please welcome the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here, let's begin the debate and let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy. President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then now costs more than $120, and typical home prices have jumped more than 30%. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?

Joe Biden ([03:45]):
We got to take a look at what I was left when I became president and what Mr. Trump left me. We had an economy that was in free fall, the pandemic was so badly handled, many people were dying. All he said was, "It's not that serious, just inject a little bleach into your arm. You'll be all right." The economy collapsed, there were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15%, it was terrible. And so what we had to do is try to put things back together again.

Donald Trump ([05:40]):
We have the greatest economy in the history of our country, we have never done so well. Everybody was amazed by it and other countries were copying us. We got hit with COVID, and when we did, we spent the money necessary, so we wouldn't end up in a great depression, the likes of which we had in 1929.

Jake Tapper ([06:40]):
Thank you. President Biden?

Joe Biden ([06:42]):
Well, look, the greatest economy in the world. He's the only one that thinks that, I think. I don't know anybody else who thinks he had the greatest economy in the world.

Jake Tapper ([07:39]):
President Trump, I want to follow up, if I can.

Donald Trump ([07:42]):
I'm not allowed to respond to him?

Dana Bash ([13:37]):
This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Former President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to the states.

Donald Trump ([14:01]):
Correct.

Dana Bash ([14:02]):
However, the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills. As president, would you block abortion medication?

Donald Trump ([14:18]):
First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion bill and I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.

[CROWD NOISE - PLEASE MAINTAIN SILENCE]

Dana Bash ([16:19]):
Thank you. President Biden?

Joe Biden ([16:20]):
It's been a terrible thing what you've done. The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe.

Jake Tapper ([20:45]):
Let's turn now to the issue of immigration and border security. President Biden, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch, overwhelming border states and overburdening cities such as New York and Chicago.

Joe Biden ([21:05]):
Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that and made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now.

Donald Trump ([22:05]):
I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence, I don't think he knows what he said either. Look, we had the safest border in the history of our country.

**CNN FACT CHECK: This claim needs verification**

Jake Tapper ([39:31]):
Let's turn to the issue of democracy. Former President Trump, I want to ask you about January 6th, 2021 after you rallied your supporters that day, some of them stormed the Capitol to stop the constitutionally mandated counting of electoral votes.

Donald Trump ([39:58]):
Well, I don't think too many believe that. And let me tell you about January 6th. On January 6th, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few.

Joe Biden ([41:58]):
Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one. I sat in the dining room off in the Oval Office, he sat there for three hours watching.

[TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY - AUDIO RESTORED]

Jake Tapper ([51:41]):
Thank you, President Biden. We're going to be right back with more from the CNN Presidential Debate.

[COMMERCIAL BREAK - 3 MINUTES]
[THIS DEBATE BROUGHT TO YOU BY...]

Dana Bash ([55:32]):
Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Georgia. Let's talk about persistent challenges you both faced in your first terms.

Joe Biden ([56:10]):
They acknowledge they made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is there's more small Black businesses that have been started than any time in history.

Donald Trump ([58:13]):
And he caused the inflation. He's blaming inflation and he's right. It's been very bad. He caused the inflation and it's killing Black families and Hispanic families.

Dana Bash ([01:00:23]):
Thank you. Another persistent challenge is the climate crisis. 2023 was the hottest year in recorded history.

Donald Trump ([01:00:50]):
Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him. Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump.
