Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here, let's begin the debate and let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy. President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then now costs more than $120, and typical home prices have jumped more than 30%. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?",

You'll be all right.\" The economy collapsed, there were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15%, it was terrible. And so what we had to do is try to put things back together again.",
